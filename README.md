# StreamLoudnessMeter

A Python library for measuring audio loudness using the EBU R128 standard.

This library supports streaming loudness measurement. 
You do not need to feed the entire file at once. You can feed audio frame by frame (streaming style) and configure different loudness modes to obtain various loudness information at any time.

## Installation

### From Source (GitHub)

Since this package is not yet published to PyPI, you need to install it from source:

1. **Clone the repository with submodules:**
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:lsl666/StreamLoudnessMeter.git
cd StreamLoudnessMeter
```
(This repository contains submodule. If you obtain the code through download on websit, please confirm that the submodule has also been successfully downloaded recursively.)

2. **Install the package:**
```bash
pip install .
```

Or for development (editable installation):
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Building from Source

If you want to build the wheel yourself:
```bash
python -m build
pip install dist/*.whl
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- CMake 3.18+
- C compiler (gcc/clang on Linux/macOS, MSVC on Windows)
- NumPy

### Example

For an example of processing WAV and get loudness, see the `example/wav_loudness_example.py` file.

## Usage

After installation, you can import and use the library:

```python
import numpy as np
from stream_loudness_meter import Ebur128, Ebur128Mode

# Configuration
channels = 2  # stereo
samplerate = 48000  # 48 kHz
mode = Ebur128Mode.EBUR128_MODE_I | Ebur128Mode.EBUR128_MODE_S  # Integrated + Short-term

# Create an instance
ebur = Ebur128(channels, samplerate, mode)

# Generate or load your audio (example with sine wave)
duration = 3.0  # seconds
t = np.linspace(0, duration, int(samplerate * duration))
audio_left = 0.5 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * 440 * t)  # 440 Hz
audio_right = 0.5 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * 554.37 * t)  # 554.37 Hz

# Interleave channels for processing
audio_data = np.column_stack([audio_left, audio_right]).flatten().astype(np.float32)

# Process audio frames
ebur.add_frames_float(audio_data)

# Get loudness measurements
global_loudness = ebur.loudness_global()
shortterm_loudness = ebur.loudness_shortterm()

print(f"Integrated Loudness: {global_loudness:.2f} LUFS")
print(f"Short-term Loudness: {shortterm_loudness:.2f} LUFS")
```

### Available Modes

- `EBUR128_MODE_M` - Momentary loudness (400ms window)
- `EBUR128_MODE_S` - Short-term loudness (3s window) 
- `EBUR128_MODE_I` - Integrated/Global loudness
- `EBUR128_MODE_LRA` - Loudness range
- `EBUR128_MODE_SAMPLE_PEAK` - Sample peak
- `EBUR128_MODE_TRUE_PEAK` - True peak
- `EBUR128_MODE_HISTOGRAM` - Histogram mode

Modes can be combined using the bitwise OR operator (`|`).

## Installation Issues
If the installation fails, please make sure all third-party libraries have been downloaded recursively, and verify that the contents under `StreamLoudnessMeter/thirdparty` are complete.
